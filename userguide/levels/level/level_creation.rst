Creating customer level
=======================

You can create unlimited amount of customizable customers levels for your loyalty program based on various conditions.

Depending on the Translations settings, **Basic information** can be provided in different language versions (listed in :doc:`Translations </userguide/getting_started/settings/translations>`).
Information from that section can be displayed in a Client cockpit depending on a chosen default language version.

**For example**, 

when default language is English, information is displayed in English, but when we change it on Polish as a default language, all basic information will be displayed in Polish (if provided).
