Stores
======

Stores functionality gives a possibility to add many stores with different currencies, codes, names. Each store has some clients and clients realize transactions only withing each store according to the currency and store code.
After creating several stores, in the top right corner, you'll see a drop-down list where you can select a store. Once the store is selected, all the displayed data is exclusive to that selected store.
There are 6 areas where the drop-down list is not visible: Configuration, Administrators, ACL, Transactions, Stores, My profile. In all of the above, settings will apply to all the stores.
