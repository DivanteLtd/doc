Using the Foundation framework
==============================

Foundation for Sites 6 includes a wide range of modular and flexible components that are easily styled. It has a large library of ready to use html, js, css `UI components <https://foundation.zurb.com/building-blocks/>`_

When you want to add a new style or some js plugin. Check the framework foundation first. It is very possible that foudation already has the solution you are looking for. We want to avoid duplicating the code. Before writing a code, read the  `Foundation for sites documentation <https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/>`_ and check what the possibilities give. There really is a lot of it.
